# Inhabitent

Inhabitent is a mock e-commerce and blog website for those who like camping. The theme is a custom Wordpress theme, and the content is largely custom posts of Lorem Ipsum style text.

## Technologies Used

HTML5, CSS3, SASS, PHP, Wordpress, JavaScript, MAMP, GULP, Git.

## Personal Learnings

This was my introduction to Wordpress and PHP, and first time creating a Wordpress theme. Inhabitent is a multi-page website, with different layouts per page, and so proved challenging to target elements to style them. However, I overcame this initial difficulty, and learnt how to combine Wordpress components, such as posts and widgets, with HTML, PHP, CSS and SASS.

## Plugins

Advanced Custom Fields, Contact Form 7, Font Awesome, Query Monitor.

## Installation Instructions

Ensure that you have Wordpress installed on your device, and replace the wp-content folder with the contents of this git repository. Log in as wp-admin and change the theme to Inhabitent.
